# 🎮 AMRCADE: Decentralized Game Arcade on Aptos Blockchain

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

AMRCADE is a decentralized pixel-style game arcade platform where:

- **Users** can **play and earn** by engaging with blockchain-published games.
- **Developers** can **publish their games**, fully owning and managing game logic and transactions.
- All games are **verified** by humans to ensure trustworthiness.
- **Aptos Crypto** is the only currency used in the ecosystem.
- Users must **recharge tokens** to maintain their play balance.

## 👤 Users

- **Access**: Users visit the arcade platform (AMRCADE) to discover games.
- **Play Requirement**: Must have a positive balance to play any game.
- **Earning**: Each game determines its own earning mechanism (e.g., rewards, leaderboards).
- **Recharge**: If the balance is low, users must recharge via Aptos tokens.

### 🔐 Balance Rules

- Stored in Aptos wallet.
- Synced in real-time with AMRCADE account.
- Used to access games (per-play or time-based as defined by each game).

## 🧑‍💻 Game Developers

- **Publishing**: Use AMRCADE's publishing portal to deploy games.
- **Ownership**: Developers retain 100% control of:
  - Smart contracts
  - Token logic
  - In-game transactions
- **Monetization**: Developer decides how to reward users or charge for gameplay.

### 🛡️ Verification

- Every submitted game undergoes **human verification** to ensure:
  - No malicious smart contract code
  - No unauthorized token draining
  - Proper user/game interaction flows

---

## 🪙 Token Economics

### 💸 Aptos Crypto

- Used to **recharge user balances**.
- Traded outside AMRCADE (via wallets or exchanges).
- Once recharged, tokens appear as game credits in AMRCADE UI.

### 💼 Game Wallets

- Each game can use its own **game wallet** and define its **token utility**.
- Game smart contracts define transaction rules independently.

## 🧩 Blockchain Infrastructure

| Component              | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Aptos Blockchain**   | All transactions, balance, and game logic run on Aptos for speed & security |
| **Smart Contracts**    | Written in Move, owned by developers                                        |
| **Wallet Integration** | Petra Wallet or any Aptos-compatible wallet used for balance & recharge     |

---

## 🕹️ Game Lifecycle

1. Developer uploads the game to AMRCADE
2. Game is verified and published
3. Users visit arcade, see all published games
4. User connects wallet and checks balance
5. If balance is low → prompt to recharge using Aptos crypto
6. User plays game → game handles rewards/transactions
7. Repeat

## ✅ Key Principles

- **Decentralization**: Arcade is only a publisher, not a controller.
- **Self-sovereignty**: Developers manage their own smart contracts.
- **Security**: Manual human verification before publishing any game.
- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on-chain.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind (AMRCADE UI)
- **Blockchain**: Aptos, Move smart contracts
- **Wallets**: Petra, Martian, Rise, etc.
- **Game Runtime**: Unity WebGL / HTML5 games
- **Verification**: Internal admin dashboard for human validators

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Game-specific token integrations
- Play-to-earn leaderboard systems
- NFT-based in-game assets
- DAO for developer publishing rights
